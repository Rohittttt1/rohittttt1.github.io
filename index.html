    <p id="eagle-1">Adult eagles are dark brown, with white feathers covering their heads. They also have yellow beaks, large talons, which they use to grab prey. Eagles fly alone because they are solitary. They are not social type of birds unless they are mating. Eagles fly high up in the sky, searching for food.
